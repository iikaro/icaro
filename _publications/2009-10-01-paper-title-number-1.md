This work describes the development of a virtual reality application, in which the legs movement of a person wearing a
lower limbs robotic exoskeleton can be tracked and reproduced virtually, while the person walks on a treadmill. It is
known that the higher the frame rate of the virtual reality application, the smaller will be the chances of the patient
being affected by motion sickness, and the greater will be his engagement. Thus, the high frame rate will be treated as a
requirement.
