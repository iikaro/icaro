title: "Analysis of Matrix Factorization Techniques for Extraction of
Motion Motor Primitive"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-CBEB-MatrixTechniques-5
excerpt: 'The present work analyzes the results yielded by four of the most used matrix factoring techniques (PCA, ICA, NNMF, SOBI) using electromyography signals. The results suggest that the PCA is the technique that best managed to reconstruct the EMG signals after their factorization, with a virtually zero relative error. The SOBI technique also yielded satisfactory results, followed by NNMF and finally ICA, which presented a reconstructed signal quite different from the original.'
