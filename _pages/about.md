<b> Hi there! Icaro speaking...</b>

Welcome to my personal website, hosted in Github, based on an amazing template (see footer for credits) which I had only to edit a few things.\
I'm a Mechatronic Engineer currently working on my master's thesis.\
My research focus on three main fields of studies:
1. Rehabilitation Robotics
1. Virtual Reality (Gamification, Immersion and Presence)
1. Interaction Control (Haptics and such)

Feel free to contact me.
